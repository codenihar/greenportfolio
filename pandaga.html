            <h2>Hey there! I'm Nihar.</h2>
            <p>
                I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Visvesvaraya College of Engineering in Bengaluru. With my experience as a web developer, I have developed over 50 websites and have gained proficiency in Python programming. However, my real interest lies in machine learning, and I'm eager to explore this field further. To achieve this goal, I'm looking for an internship opportunity in full-stack development that can help me develop my skills and gain practical experience.
<br><br>
My passion for technology and programming has been the driving force behind my desire to constantly improve my skills. Although I'm still in the early stages of my career, I'm always looking for new ways to challenge myself and expand my knowledge. This is what led me to pursue a degree in Artificial Intelligence, which has given me a solid foundation in the field of machine learning.
<br><br>
My experience in web development has also been a crucial part of my journey so far. By creating websites for various clients, I've gained a deep understanding of front-end and back-end development, as well as various web development frameworks. These skills have equipped me with a strong foundation in full-stack development, and I'm excited to apply them to more complex projects.
<br><br>
Ultimately, my goal is to make meaningful contributions to the tech industry by building intelligent applications that can solve real-world problems. By seeking out internship opportunities in full-stack development, I hope to gain practical experience that can help me achieve this goal. With my proactive and driven approach, I'm confident that I can add value to any organization that I work with.
